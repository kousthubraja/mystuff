<p>Do you think you know enough about aerodynamics? Do you feel you can make and 
fly a paper aircraft that can clear the world record of 226 feet and 10 inches? Well here 
is the opportunity all of you were waiting for - Aerogami.
</p>
<p>
A fun event for students who are skilled and creative in the field 
of aerodynamics, the event challenges the students to make paper airplanes using a 
simple A-4 sheet and let it fly over the largest possible distance.
</p>
