        <Description>These are squid server cache reports. Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I&amp;#039;ve noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* (&amp;#039;scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario. Let&amp;#039;s say there&amp;#039;s not security problems revealed in these logs. Best case scenario is that outsiders can see what your company/agency/workers are surfing.</Description>

        <Keyword>intitle:&quot;Welcome to IIS 4.0&quot;</Keyword>
        <Description>Moving from personal, lightweight web servers into more production-ready software, we find that even administrators of Microsoft&amp;#039;s Internet Information Server (IIS) sometimes don&amp;#039;t have a clue what they&amp;#039;re doing. By searching on web pages with titles of &quot;Welcome to IIS 4.0&quot; we find that even if they&amp;#039;ve taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.For all the things money can&amp;#039;t buy, there&amp;#039;s a googleDork award.</Description>

More than one server has been compromised by a hacker&amp;#039;s discovery of sensitive information contained in backup files or directories. Some of the sites in this search meant to reveal the contents of their backup directories, others did not. Think about it. What.s in YOUR backup directories? Would you care to share the contents with the whole of the online world? Probably not. Whether intentional or not, bsp.gsa.gov reveals backup directory through Google. Is this simply yet another misconfigured .gov site? You decide. BSP stands for &quot;best security practices,&quot; winning this site the Top GoogleDork award for this category.</Description>

Opera saves this file on you&amp;#039;r computer, it is located (on winXP) here: D:Documents and SettingsPeefyProgramdataOperaOpera75profilewand.dat for me offcourse, change it so its suitable for you..But, if you don&amp;#039;t have a descrambler or whatever, the passwords arent cleartext, but you have to put the wand file in the location specified above, then open opera, click tools, Wand Passwords, then see the URL&amp;#039;s saved, then go to theese URL&amp;#039;s and click the wand button.</Description>

PhaserSMART, our diagnostic system, examines the information, diagnoses the issue, and immediately walks you through a proposed solution. Automatic alerts minimize printer management problems. Alerts notify you via email when it&amp;#039;s time to replace supplies, or when service is required.&quot;Moderator note: you may not be able to connect to the links Google gives if the printers are turned off when not in use.</Description>

These software solutions are often used by companies offering a &quot;simple&quot; but &quot;cost effective&quot; way to their users who don&amp;#039;t know unix or html. There is a problem sometimes with this specific filemanager due to insecure use of the session ID that can be found in the unprotected &quot;fileman.log&quot; logfile. It has been reported that an attacker can abuse the last document-edit-url of the logfile. By copy pasting that line in a new window it gives the attacker valid user credentials on the server, at least for a while.. (think hours not seconds).</Description>

Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the &quot;pathext&quot; (directory) and &quot;view&quot; (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the &quot;pathext&quot; variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the &quot;view&quot; variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/&amp;view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.</Description>

        <Description>Netware servers ( v5 and up ) use a web-based management utility called Portal services, which can be used to view files on a volume, view server health statistics, etc. While you must log into the Portal Manager to view any of the data, it will accept blank passwords. So any Netware username defined in the server&amp;#039;s NDS database w/o a password can authenticate.After the Google results are displayed, an attacker wil go to the company base web url and learn about employees, preferably their email addresses. Then bounce to the portal management login and try their username w/o a password.</Description>

        <Description>http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10968/discussion/&quot;A vulnerability is reported to exist in Gallery that may allow a remote attacker to execute malicious scripts on a vulnerable system. This issue is a design error that occurs due to the &amp;#039;set_time_limit&amp;#039; function.The issue presents itself because the &amp;#039;set_time_limit&amp;#039; function forces the application to wait for 30-seconds before the verification and discarding of non-image files takes place. This allows for a window of opportunity for an attacker to execute a malicious script on a server.Gallery 1.4.4 is reported prone to this issue, however, other versions may be affected as well. &quot;</Description>

        <Keyword>inurl:&quot;nph-proxy.cgi&quot; &quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy&quot;</Keyword>
        <Description>Observing the web cracker in the wild, one feels like they are watching a bear. Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy&amp;#039;s default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:&quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.&quot;The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:&quot;nph-proxy.cgi&quot; &quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy&quot;More results can be obtained by admitting the &quot;inurl:nph-proxy.cgi&quot; constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.</Description>

If they do, they can import a root certificate into their browsers (IE).Anyways, this search by JimmyNeutron uncovers a few of these certificate servers directly connected to the Internet.

        <Description>&quot;Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the Neomail version 1.14 from Ernie Miller. Open WebMail is designed to manage very large mail folder files in a memory efficient way. It also provides a range of features to help users migrate smoothly from Microsoft Outlook to Open WebMail&quot;. A remote attacker can run arbitrary commands with the web server&amp;#039;s privileges by exploiting an unfiltered parameter in userstat.pl.   Details  Vulnerable Systems:  * Open Webmail versions 2.20, 2.21 and 2.30  * Limited exploitation on openwebmail-current.tgz that was released on 2004-04-30 (See below)   The vulnerability was discovered in an obsolete script named userstat.pl shipped with Open Webmail. The script doesn&amp;#039;t properly filter out shell characters from the loginname parameter. The loginname parameter is used as an argument when executing openwebmail-tool.pl from the vulnerable script. By adding a &quot;;&quot;, &quot;|&quot; or &quot;( )&quot; followed by the shell command to a http GET, HEAD or POST request an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands as an unprivileged user (the Apache user, &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;www&quot;, e.g.).</Description>

Due to an input validation error in Plesk Server Administrator, it is possible for a remote attacker to make a specially crafted web request which will display PHP source code.   This is acheivable by connecting to a host (using the IP address rather than the domain name), and submitting a request for a known PHP file along with a valid username.  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3737</Description>

It is also possible to perform SQL injection attacks on the SQL serverthat is used as the data store for the SalesLogix CRM system, reveal detailed error reports contained in HTTP headers and disclose the real filesystem paths to various SalesLogix directories. The SalesLogix server itself is vulnerable to an attack that wouldallow a malicious user to obtain the username and password used to access the SQL server used as a data store. The disclosed username and password always have read/write permissions on the database. Another vulnerability in the SalesLogix server allows anunauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the server in any directory (s)he chooses.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11450</Description>

        <Description>It is reported that DMXReady Site Chassis Manager is susceptible to two remotely exploitable input validation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data.The first issue is an unspecified cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.The second issue is an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability. It may be possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the underlying database used by the application. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.</Description>

This script prompts for a host and port which it then attempts to connect to. If a web server, such as apache, is running this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports, allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial of service attacks, proxied port scans, etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established.</Description>

        <Description>Well what can be said about this one, I&amp;#039;ve added it to the DB under Juicy info, however it could have easilly gone under virtually any of the lists as it just give out Soooo much info. I can for instance find out the admin username (not just the adin every user) and also if it password protected and if the password ever expires plus is it a current user account, also do the same for any guest accounts, Ok nice and easy how about the O/S and all the Mapped Drive locations all there along with installed software and even currently running applications and processes. Site admins would have to be mad to leave this stuff open, but as we all know from the GHDB Site admins do weird and funny stuff. This one just gives out to much to list, so go have a look and see what you can find.</Description>

        <Description>This query shows pages which summarise activity on BNBT-powered BitTorrent trackers - including all the torrents currently being &quot;tracked&quot;, the BNBT software version, links to user-lists and &amp;#039;admin&amp;#039; pages, etc.This is useful to people who want to find active BitTorrent trackers for downloading - including ones which aren&amp;#039;t &amp;#039;public&amp;#039;. It is also useful for people wanting to gain some clues into a tracker&amp;#039;s/site&amp;#039;s setup. Some versions of BNBT are also vulnerable to a DOS attack. People targetting BitTorrent trackers because of the questionable legality of their general usage may also find this query useful!</Description>

        <Description>Reportedly Coppermine Photo Gallery is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities, some of which may lead to arbitrary command execution. These issues are due to the application failing to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input prior to using it in dynamic content and system command execution function calls.These issues may be exploited to steal cookie based authentication credentials, map the application root directory of the affected application, execute arbitrary commands and include arbitrary files. Other attacks are also possible.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10253/</Description>

This can be exploited to disclose arbitrary images from external and local resources via directory traversal attacks, or to disclose the installation path.It is also possible to disclose the system path by accessing certain scripts directly or specially formed parameters.</Description>

Multilanguage, Multitemplate, quick/simple search, feedback with webmaster, Admin maillist, Very customizable &quot; etc.   vulnerability: look at the vulnerable code in ./include/security.inc.php at lines ~80-90 ... else    {    if (isset($l) &amp;&amp; file_exists(C_PATH.&amp;#039;/languages/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;.php&amp;#039;) &amp;&amp; $l != &amp;#039;&amp;#039;)       {               include_once C_PATH.&amp;#039;/languages/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;.php&amp;#039;;          include_once C_PATH.&amp;#039;/languages/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;/&amp;#039;.$l.&amp;#039;_.php&amp;#039;;    } ... you can include arbitrary file on the server using &quot;../&quot; and null byte (%00) (to truncate path to the filename you choose), example: http://[target]/[path]/azdg//include/security.inc.php?l=../../../../../../../[filename.ext]%00 at the begin of the script we have: @ob_start(); look at the php ob_ start man page : &quot;This function will turn output buffering on. While output buffering is active no output is sent from the script (other than headers), instead the output is stored in an internal buffer.&quot; However, this is not a secure way to protect a script: buffer is never showned, so you cannot see arbitrary file from the target machine this time ... but you can execute arbirtrary commands and after to see any file :) : when you register to azdg you can upload photos, so you can upload and include a gif or jpeg file like this:  usually photos are uploaded to ./members/uploads/[subdir]/[newfilename].[ext] azdg calculates [subdir] &amp; [newfilename] using date(), time() and rand() functions you cannot calculate but you can retrieve the filename from azdg pages when file is showned on screen (!), so you can do this: http://[target]/[path]/azdg//include/security.inc.php?l=../../../members/uploads/[subdir]/[filename.ext]%00&amp;cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd the output will be redirected to ./include/temp.txt so you make a GET request of this file and you have /etc/passwd file you can find my poc exploit at this url:http://rgod.altervista.org/azdg.html</Description>

Since the sql id and password are plain text, it&amp;#039;s easy to connect to the SQL server once you have this information... especially those that use &quot;server=127.0.0.1&quot; so you know IIS &amp; SQL Server are running on the same box.</Description>

These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.The application is prone to HTML-injection and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Arbitrary script code may also be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site; this may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17481/discuss</Description>

        <Description>A foothold using allintext:&quot;fs-admin.php&quot; shows the world readable directories of a plug-in that enables Wordpress to be used as a forum. Many of the results of the search also show error logs which give an attacker the server side paths including the home directory name. This name is often also used for the login to ftp and shell access, which exposes the system to attack. There is also an undisclosed flaw in version 1.3 of the software, as the author has mentioned in version 1.4 as a security fix, but does not tell us what it is that was patched.&lt;br /&gt;

widely abused by others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google Dork &quot;allinurl:forcedownload.php?file=&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sites that use the forcedownload.php script are vulnerable to url &lt;br /&gt;
manipulation, and will spit out any file on the local site, including the &lt;br /&gt;
PHP files themselves with all server side code, not the rendered page, but &lt;br /&gt;
the source itself. This is most commonly used on wordpress sites to grab the &lt;br /&gt;
wp-config.php file to gain access to the database, but is not limited to &lt;br /&gt;
wordpress sites. I only list it as an example, so people understand the &lt;br /&gt;
weight of flaw.&lt;br /&gt;
