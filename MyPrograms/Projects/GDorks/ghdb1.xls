Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I&amp;#039;ve noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* (&amp;#039;scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario.

By searching on web pages with titles of &quot;Welcome to IIS 4.0&quot; we find that even if they&amp;#039;ve taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.For all the things money can&amp;#039;t buy, there&amp;#039;s a googleDork award.</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>15</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2003-06-24</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>&quot;Index of /backup&quot;</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Backup directories are often very interesting places to explore. More than one server has been compromised by a hacker&amp;#039;s discovery of sensitive information contained in backup files or directories. Some of the sites in this search meant to reveal the contents of their backup directories, others did not. Think about it. What.s in YOUR backup directories? Would you care to share the contents with the whole of the online world? Probably not. Whether intentional or not, bsp.gsa.gov reveals backup directory through Google. Is this simply yet another misconfigured .gov site? You decide.

A BIG security problem popped up within the OpenBSD/Apache combo back in the day.Now, every administrator that advertised this particular combo with cute little banners has a problem.

Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the &quot;pathext&quot; (directory) and &quot;view&quot; (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the &quot;pathext&quot; variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the &quot;view&quot; variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/&amp;view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>388</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2004-07-29</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>allinurl:&quot;index.php&quot; &quot;site=sglinks&quot;</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Easyins Stadtportal v4 is a German Content Management System for cities and regions.

Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy&amp;#039;s default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:&quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.&quot;The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:&quot;nph-proxy.cgi&quot; &quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy&quot;More results can be obtained by admitting the &quot;inurl:nph-proxy.cgi&quot; constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>467</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2004-09-10</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>intitle:&quot;Index of *&quot; inurl:&quot;my shared folder&quot; size modified</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>These are index pages of &quot;My Shared Folder&quot;.

These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.The application is prone to HTML-injection and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Arbitrary script code may also be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site; this may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17481/discuss</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1337</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2006-04-25</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>&quot;powered by active php bookmarks&quot; | inurl:bookmarks/view_group.php?id=</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Active PHP Bookmarks, a web based bookmark manager, was originally developed by Brandon Stone.

the source itself. This is most commonly used on wordpress sites to grab the &lt;br /&gt;
wp-config.php file to gain access to the database, but is not limited to &lt;br /&gt;
wordpress sites. I only list it as an example, so people understand the &lt;br /&gt;
