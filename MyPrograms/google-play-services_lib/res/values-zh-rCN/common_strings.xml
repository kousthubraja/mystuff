 * The maximum ASN's the processor supports.  On the EV4 this is 63
 * but the PAL-code doesn't actually use this information.  On the
 * EV5 this is 127, and EV6 has 255.
 *
 * On the EV4, the ASNs are more-or-less useless anyway, as they are
 * only used as an icache tag, not for TB entries.  On the EV5 and EV6,
 * ASN's also validate the TB entries, and thus make a lot more sense.
 *
 * The EV4 ASN's don't even match the architecture manual, ugh.  And
 * I quote: "If a processor implements address space numbers (ASNs),
 * and the old PTE has the Address Space Match (ASM) bit clear (ASNs
 * in use) and the Valid bit set, then entries can also effectively be
 * made coherent by assigning a new, unused ASN to the currently
 * running process and not reusing the previous ASN before calling the
 * appropriate PALcode routine to invalidate the translation buffer (TB)". 
 *
 * In short, the EV4 has a "kind of" ASN capability, but it doesn't actually
 * work correctly and can thus not be used (explaining the lack of PAL-code
 * support).
